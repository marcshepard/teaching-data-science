I created this repository to store notebooks I can use to teach data science to students.

It currently has just one lesson; 'intro-to-neural-nets.ipynb'. For that lesson, please follow these setup steps:
1. Create a google colab account if you don't already have one. https://colab.research.google.com/. Colab (by Google) was specifically built for creating and sharing interactive python data science code, and it's free tier is quite feature rich.
2. Clone my notebook like so:
    1. Go to "Open Notebook" (it should have popped up by default, but if not you can find it under the "File" menu)
    2. Select "GitHub"
    3. Enter the following path: https://github.com/marcshepard/teaching-data-science/blob/main/intro-to-neural-nets.ipynb
    4. Click the search icon

Congratulations, you now have a copy of the notebook. Notice the file extension is "ipynb", that stands for "interactive python notebook" and it is made up of alternative blocks of "markdown" (text/images) and "code cells" (things you can run interactively). For the rest of the lesson, we'll work through the notebook together. Don't worry if you don't understand the Python code - this is motivational for the type of things you can do in Python with very little code; and by the end of the year you'll have a solid grasp of Python that will let you write code like this as well.

If you want to learn the details of how all this works, consider another free Google resource, https://www.kaggle.com/learn:
1. Intro to programming and Python are each 4-hour lesson on Python fundementals for data science
2. Intro to Machine Learning let's you learn some fundemental machine learning techniques that apply broadly (including to neural nets)
3. Intro to deep learning is where you will learn how to program simple neural nets, and Computer vision is good follow-up neural net class (which uses more advanced techniques than we use in this notebook).
There are a ton of other useful classes there as well; each is about 4 hours of self-paced learning. And it's free. In particular, I highly recomment Pandas, Intermediate Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Feature engineering, data cleaning, explainability, and AI ethics as additional classes to take if you want to continue to learn more.
