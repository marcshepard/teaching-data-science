I created this repository to store notebooks I can use to teach data science to students. Each notebook is self-contained. Here's what each does:
1) The intro-to-neural-nets notebook is the first one I created
2) The training one was created for a high school advanced calculus class as a supplement

For the first lesson, 'intro-to-neural-nets.ipynb', please follow these setup steps:
1. Create a google colab account if you don't already have one. https://colab.research.google.com/. Colab (by Google) was specifically built for creating and sharing interactive python data science code, and it's free tier is quite feature rich.
2. Clone my notebook like so:
    1. Go to "Open Notebook" (it should have popped up by default, but if not you can find it under the "File" menu)
    2. Select "GitHub"
    3. Enter the following path: https://github.com/marcshepard/teaching-data-science
    4. Select intro-to-neural-nets.ipynb
    5. Click the search icon

Congratulations, you now have a copy of the notebook. Notice the file extension is "ipynb", that stands for "interactive python notebook" and it is made up of alternative blocks of "markdown" (text/images) and "code cells" (things you can run interactively). For the rest of the lesson, we'll work through the notebook together. Don't worry if you don't understand the Python code - this is motivational for the type of things you can do in Python with very little code; and by the end of the year you'll have a solid grasp of Python that will let you write code like this as well.
