    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a simple overview of how to use the open AI APIs to build some simple applications. Currently there are two:\n",
    "1) A simple chatbot app; \"AI therapist\"\n",
    "2) An inexpensive text-to-image generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get an OpenAI API key for free for a trial period. Even after the trial finishes, you may decide to keep using it as it is a relative bargain. Consider:\n",
    "1) OpenAI plus is $20/month, and it is required to use DALL-E, or to get more access to the latest chatGPT models\n",
    "2) Meanwhile, at the API level, you can generate images for just a few cents per image, and perform chat sessions for less than a penny per session."

    "# Prereqs\n",
    "\n",
    "To get things set up, you'll need to set up a google colab account to run this notebook (and then modify/personalize it). You will also need to get an OpenAI API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sign up for a Google Colab account\n",
    "1. Create a [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com) account if you don't already have one. Colab was specifically built for creating and sharing interactive python data science code, and it's free tier is quite feature rich.\n",
    "2. Clone this notebook like so:\n",
    "    1. Go to \"Open Notebook\" (it should have popped up by default, but if not you can find it under the \"File\" menu)\n",
    "    2. Select \"GitHub\"\n",
    "    3. Enter the following path: https://github.com/marcshepard/teaching-data-science/blob/main/openai.ipynb\n",
    "    4. Click the search icon\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obtain an OpenAI API key\n",
    "Go to the [Open AI developer](https://platform.openai.com) site.\n",
    "Click on \"API keys\" on the left tab.\n",
    "Create a new \"project API SECRET key\".\n",
    "1. *Keep it somewhere* - once you move off that screen you can never see the secret again. They won't let you view it later after you have created it. \n",
    "2. *Keep it secret* - don't put it on any public sites or anywhere others can get at it.\n",
    "Here's an idea: Store it as a Google Colab secret (next section), as Colab will keep it secret and allows you to view it later if you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Copy your API key to Colab as a secret\n",
    "Meanwhile in Colab, click on the key icon on the left nav.\n",
    "Click \"Add new secret\":\n",
    "* Give it a name of \"OPENAI_KEY\"\n",
    "* Paste the value you got from OpenAI.\n",
    "* Toggle the \"Notebook access\" button\n",
    "\n",

    "Let's start in the Chat tab:\n",
    "\n",
    "**System** The System message guides how the chatbot responds. Try entering the following text (or something else if you prefer):\n",
    "<p style=\"margin:10px\">You are an AI therapist with great empathy and listening skills, specializing in CBT, DBT, and committed to helping your patients understand and work through any psychological challenges they may have</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of the screen, enter some message, like \"hi, doc\" and then click \"run\". Have a quick chat. Then take a few minutes to play around with other configurations:\n",
    "* Different System contexts\n",
    "* Different values of the sliders on the right:\n",
    "    * Temperature - higher = more creative/random responses; lower = more deterministic\n",
    "    * Top P - similar effect to temperature\n",
    "    * Frequency - higher = less repetition in the output (e.g, for creative writing)\n",
    "    * Presense - higher = increase likelyhood to introduce new topics (e.g., for brainstorming)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assistant\n",
    "Assistant is a newer chat model that adds:\n",
    "1. *Files* can be attached to help with assistant replies. E.g., for an API therapist attachments migh include previous diagnosis for the patient, as this is important context but something that would not have been on the public internet when GPT was trained.\n",
    "2. *Code interpreter and functions* to allow it to perform actions, so you can build agents.\n",
    "3. *JSON response* support, in case you want structured data back that you can use in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give it a whirl:\n",
    "* Add Instructions (the equivalent of Context for chat)\n",
    "* Upload a file document\n",
    "* Ask it some questions (e.g., summarize this document)\n",
